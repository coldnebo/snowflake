======================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Windows 7 (32-bit).
OpenGL capable card; minumum GLSL 1.20.  
Developed on Windows 7 64-bit / EVGA NVIDIA GTX 260 (896MB) running 
on an Intel Core i7 920 @ 2.67 GHz with 6GB RAM.

======================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN:

Simply unzip this archive into a folder and open the kyrala_l folder
and double click "snowflake.exe" to run it.

(After the class and when this has been posted, I may post this project to my
github account.  See https://github.com/coldnebo for updates.)

======================================================================
HOW TO COMPILE:

You will need the Cinder libraries and headers in order to compile this
project.  

If you are a TF, please see the cinder-dist.zip that I've uploaded to
the dropbox.  Download this and extract it to the kyrala_l folder so that you
see the following directory structure:

kyrala_l/
  cinder_dist/
  snowflake/
  
If you are seeing this file after the class, then please go to http://libcinder.org/
and download Cinder for Visual C++ 2010.  (This project was compiled against
Cinder version 0.8.2).  You will either a) need to extract and rename the 
folder to "cinder_dist", or b) change references of cinder_dist to "cinder_0.8.2_vc2010"
in the project settings.

Once you have this setup, you should be able to open the sln solution file in 
Visual Studio 2010.  Select "Debug" or "Release" and build the solution.  Since
all the resources are compiled into the solution you should simply be able to 
run it or debug it in place.

(If this is after the class: I haven't tried compiling it on Mac, however 
Cinder supports this... you might need to download the other package for Cinder instead.)
